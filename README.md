Made correct string for formattedMessage in [react-intl](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl).
<br />
E.g.:
```js
<FormattedMessage
  id="terms.access.paragraph-4"
  defaultMessage={"You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary for you to have access " +
   "to our Website. You are also responsible for ensuring that all persons who access our Website " +
   "through your internet connection are aware of these Terms, and that they comply with them."
  }
/>
```
